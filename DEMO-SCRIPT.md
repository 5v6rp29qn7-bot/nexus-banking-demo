---

## PHASE 1: TOUR + CONTEXT (0:00 - 1:30)

### When Tour Overlay Appears

**[DON'T CLICK YET — Let it sit for 3 seconds]**

**SAY:** 
> "This is Nexus — what we've built for UAE banks. It gives them Esri-grade location intelligence through a simple conversation. No GIS team required. Let me walk you through it."

**[CLICK: "Next" button]**

**[Tour Step 2 - Market Signals]**

**SAY:**
> "On the left, you see live market signals — population shifts, competitor moves, regulatory alerts. These come from Esri, government feeds, and partner data. All hosted on Moro infrastructure."

**[CLICK: "Next" button]**

**[Tour Step 3 - Map]**

**SAY:**
> "The map shows their branch network overlaid with Esri intelligence. Green dots are healthy branches. Red and amber are ones with risk or opportunity signals."

**[POINT MOUSE TO: The green security badge at bottom-right of map]**

**SAY:**
> "And notice here — 'Data Sovereign: Moro Hub Secure Cloud.' The bank's data never leaves UAE. That's the Moro differentiator."

**[CLICK: "Next" button]**

**[Tour Step 4 - Chat]**

**SAY:**
> "This is where the magic happens. Instead of running reports or hiring analysts, executives just ask questions in plain English."

**[CLICK: "Next" button → then "Get Started" to close tour]**

## PHASE 2: EXPAT OPPORTUNITY (1:30 - 3:30)

**[WAIT 3 SECONDS — Let the initial message load with the 4 KPI cards]**

**SAY:**
> "The system has already identified key opportunities. AED 210 million in growth opportunity, 32% underbanked population. This is CBUAE's financial inclusion mandate in action."

**[CLICK: First chip — "Where should we target expat customers?"]**

**[WAIT for map to fly to Dubai South — gold marker will pulse]**

**SAY:**
> "Watch the map. It's flying to Dubai South — the highest-priority zone. 88% of the UAE is expats, and this area has 34% population growth with only one branch serving 45,000 residents."

**[POINT TO: The ROI cards showing "AED 210M-260M" deposit uplift]**

**SAY:**
> "The platform quantifies every opportunity in AED. This isn't a guess — it's Esri demographics combined with branch transaction data."

**[POINT TO: The provenance section at bottom of response]**

**SAY:**
> "And here's the key — full data provenance. The bank knows exactly where every number comes from. No black boxes."

**[CLICK: Chip — "Deep dive: Dubai South"]**

**SAY:**
> "Let's go deeper. The system breaks down the demographic profile — 62% Indian nationals in logistics, 18% Pakistani, 9% Filipino. It tells them exactly who to target and how."

---

## PHASE 3: SITE SELECTION (3:30 - 5:00)

**SAY:**
> "Now let's look at branch planning — where should they actually open next?"

**[SCROLL UP in chat if needed, OR CLICK: "Return to overview" chip if visible]**

**[TYPE IN CHAT BOX: "Next branch in Abu Dhabi"]** 
**[PRESS ENTER]**

**[WAIT for response + map animation]**

**SAY:**
> "They just asked a simple question — 'where should we open in Abu Dhabi?' Watch what comes back."

**[POINT TO: The 3 location cards - Al Reem, Yas, Khalifa]**

**SAY:**
> "Three options, ranked. Al Reem Island: AED 42 million deposit potential, 18-month payback, only 4% cannibalization of existing branches. This is the kind of analysis that used to take weeks with a GIS team. Now it's instant."

**[POINT TO: Payback periods]**

**SAY:**
> "Everything is quantified for the board. Payback period, revenue projection, cannibalization risk."

---

## PHASE 4: FLOOD RISK (5:00 - 6:30)

**SAY:**
> "Now here's where it gets really interesting — climate risk. Remember April 2024? 100 millimeters of rain in 12 hours, largest flood event in UAE history."

**[CLICK: Chip — "Show flood risk exposure"]**

**[WAIT for response + map to show flood zones if applicable]**

**SAY:**
> "The system immediately shows AED 1.24 billion in mortgage exposure across flood zones. 2,145 properties. This is the data CBUAE is now mandating that banks report on."

**[POINT TO: Al Quoz exposure details]**

**SAY:**
> "Al Quoz alone — AED 420 million exposure, 847 properties. And only 23% have flood insurance. This is where Khatib & Alami's flood modeling comes in."

**[POINT TO: Provenance showing "K&A Flood Modeling"]**

**SAY:**
> "See the data source? K&A flood modeling. This is the Moro ecosystem in action — Esri, K&A, Nexus, all unified through one platform."

---

## PHASE 5: TRADE CORRIDOR (6:30 - 7:30)

**SAY:**
> "One more — supply chain intelligence. Red Sea disruptions are hitting UAE banks' trade finance clients."

**[CLICK: Chip — "Trade corridor risks"]**

**SAY:**
> "847 clients scanned. 15 with high exposure. AED 194 million at risk from Red Sea routing delays. This is Knowledge Graph technology — understanding the connections between the bank's clients and global shipping routes."

**[POINT TO: The client exposure details]**

**SAY:**
> "For each high-risk client, they can drill down — see the supplier network, the shipping routes, the alternatives. This is proactive risk management, not reactive."

---

## PHASE 6: THE CLOSE — PILOT DELIVERABLES (7:30 - 8:30)

**SAY:**
> "So Abhigyan, you asked what banks would actually get. Let me show you."

**[CLICK: Chip — "Show pilot deliverables"]**

**[WAIT for the 6-week timeline and deliverables list to load]**

**SAY:**
> "This is our 6-week pilot. The bank gets:"

**[POINT TO EACH ITEM AS YOU SAY IT:]**

> "Three board-ready maps — network optimization, expat opportunity, climate exposure."
> 
> "One ROI memo with AED impact quantification."
> 
> "One CBUAE-ready flood concentration report."
> 
> "One trade corridor exposure list with mitigation recommendations."

**[POINT TO: Bottom KPI cards showing "Timeline: 6 weeks" and "GIS Team Required: None"]**

**SAY:**
> "Six weeks. No GIS team required. Data stays in UAE on Moro infrastructure. That's the pilot."

---

## PHASE 7: PRICING (8:30 - 9:30)

**[SWITCH TO: Pricing slide tab]**

**SAY:**
> "On pricing — we've structured this to minimize risk for the bank."

**[POINT TO: Pilot tier]**

**SAY:**
> "The pilot is AED 350 to 450K, depending on scope. 2-3 use cases, 6 weeks, everything I just showed you delivered as outputs."

**[POINT TO: Annual license]**

**SAY:**
> "If they see value, they move to an annual license at AED 900K to 1.2 million. Moro handles hosting, support, and billing — single relationship."

**[POINT TO: Moro note at top]**

**SAY:**
> "And most importantly — Moro is the face to the customer. You're not asking them to manage three vendors. One contract, one support line, one data residency guarantee."

---

## PHASE 8: HANDOFF (9:30 - 10:00)

**SAY:**
> "So the question for this call: which banks should we approach first? Al Waha is a demo — but FAB, ENBD, ADCB all have these exact challenges. Flood exposure, branch optimization, expat inclusion."

**[PAUSE — Let them respond]**

**IF THEY ASK "Is this real data?":**
> "The infrastructure is real. The Esri demographic data is real. The customer data is synthetic for this demo to protect privacy. In the pilot, we connect to the bank's actual data lake through Moro's secure infrastructure."

**IF THEY ASK "How long to deploy?":**
> "Six weeks for the pilot. We've done this before — ADNOC, DEWA, Target. Same platform, different use cases."

**IF THEY ASK "What do you need from the bank?":**
> "Minimal. Branch locations, anonymized transaction data, and access to someone who can validate outputs. Most of the intelligence comes from Esri and partner data — that's the point."
